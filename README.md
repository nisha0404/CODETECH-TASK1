OVERVIEW OF THE PEOJECT:
TASK ONE: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

OBJECT:
Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy,
and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations,
and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
Data Exploration with Pandas and NumPy:
Pandas: This powerful library allows you to load, clean, and analyze tabular data. You can read data from various sources (CSV files, databases, etc.) and perform operations like filtering, aggregation, and transformation.
NumPy: It provides specialized data structures and functions for numerical computing in Python. You can work with arrays, matrices, and perform mathematical operations efficiently.
Visualizing Data with Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Matplotlib: A versatile plotting library that offers a wide range of visualization options. You can create line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more.
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides higher-level functions for creating attractive statistical visualizations. Itâ€™s especially useful for exploring relationships between variables.
Steps for EDA:
Load Data: Read your dataset using Pandas (e.g., from a CSV file).
Summary Statistics: Compute basic statistics (mean, median, etc.) to understand central tendencies and spread.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms to visualize feature distributions.
Correlation Analysis: Use scatter plots or correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers.
Visualize Relationships: Create scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if needed.
Draw Insights: Interpret findings and generate useful insights
